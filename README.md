## This project uses Radix Tree ( an optimization for Trie Tree to store and retrieve data)

With the use of Radix Tree, serialization of data takes 40% less space than the use of Trie Tree. This data structure provide a O(k) search, delete, and insert, with k <= 26. When data gets bigger, this data structure becomes more efficient. 

To create a serialized file, access the radixTree.js and scroll towards the end. Follow the instruction and run node radixTree you should see a text file in the folder containing the serialized file
